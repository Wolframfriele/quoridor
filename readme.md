# Quoridor implementation

Quoridor is a game where the goal is to be the first player to walk their pawn to the opposite side. Each turn you can either move your pawn or place a wall. Each player can place 10 walls, but there always needs to be a route for each pawn to reach the opposite side.

This repository contains code related to playing Quoridor.
